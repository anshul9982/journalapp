# JournalApp - A Spring Boot Application

Welcome to **JournalApp**, a comprehensive journaling application built with the Spring ecosystem. This project demonstrates a modern, robust backend architecture featuring secure user authentication, asynchronous event handling with Apache Kafka, caching with Redis, and detailed API documentation with OpenAPI.

This application is designed not just for functionality but also as a showcase of best practices in building scalable and maintainable enterprise-level Java applications.

---

# Key Features :

-   **Secure Authentication**: End-to-end security with **Spring Security** and **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for stateless, secure API access.
-   **User & Role Management**: Clear separation of roles (USER, ADMIN) with distinct permissions. Admins can manage user roles.
-   **Full CRUD Functionality**: Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete their personal journal entries.
-   **Asynchronous Processing**: Integrated with **Apache Kafka** to process events (like new journal entries) asynchronously, making the system more resilient and scalable.
-   **High-Performance Caching**: Utilizes **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.
-   **Scheduled Sentiment Analysis**: A scheduled task runs periodically to analyze the sentiment of new journal entries and updates user profiles accordingly.
-   **Email Notifications**: Users receive periodic email summaries or notifications powered by **Spring Mail**.
-   **Inspirational Quotes**: Fetches random inspirational quotes from an external API to display to users.
-   **Interactive API Documentation**: Comes with a built-in **Swagger UI** for easy exploration and testing of all available API endpoints.

# Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
*   Java (JDK 17 or newer)
*   Maven
*   MongoDB
*   Redis
*   Apache Kafka & Zookeeper

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/anshul9982/journalapp.git
    cd journalapp
    ```

2.  **Configure the application:**
    Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` and update the connection details for your local environment (MongoDB, Redis, Kafka, JWT Secret).

    ```properties
    # MongoDB Configuration
    spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/journal-db

    # Redis Configuration
    spring.data.redis.host=localhost
    spring.data.redis.port=6379

    # Kafka Configuration
    spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092
    spring.kafka.consumer.group-id=journal-group
    spring.kafka.template.default-topic=journal-entries

    # JWT Secret Key
    jwt.secret=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY_FOR_JWT_GENERATION_WHICH_IS_LONG_ENOUGH

    # External Quote API
    quote.api.url=https://api.quotable.io/random
    ```

3.  **Build and run the application:** 
    ```sh
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.
